# MPG-Predictions

Lab of MPG Predictions


### Project Summary - What is the project about 
This project is about preforming analysts and creating a linear Regression model to predict the effects of horepower on mpg. Lastly, we use flask to display the final project. 






## Summary 




## Model 
For the model I used a Linear Regression model as the main source, 

I found that using a Linear Regression model 60% of the horsepower effects on mpg, so vehicles that have more horsepower have a greater mpg.

## Problem Statement
This project is to understand the relationship between mpg and horsepower by creating a Linear Regression Model.
